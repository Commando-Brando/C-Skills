# C-Skills

##About
A collection of various C programs I have written 

##Projects
* binary_course_file_reader - reads in course data from a .txt file, stores the data in an array of course structs, writes the data to binary files, and can read/write the binary files
* process_concurrency_manager - manages linux command line processes so that certain ones can be ran concurrent
* Stack - my own personal stack program made for processing calulcator calculations but can be generalized to most data sets
* Queue - my own personal queue program made for processing grocery shoppers but can be generalized to other data sets
* HashTable - my own personal HashTable program made for processing NBA teams but can be generalized to other data sets
* Graph - implemented a graph using an adjacency matrix to compute a shortest path between two vertices using breadth first search and assisted with a queue data structure I wrote
